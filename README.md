## Scam Detection with Naïve Bayes

### Technologies: 
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Project Overview:

Developed supervised and semi-supervised multinomial naïve Bayes models to classify SMS messages as either “scam” or “non-malicious” using text features. The project involved data pre-processing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and extension with unlabelled data for semi-supervised learning.

### Key Features:
- Implemented multinomial naïve Bayes classifier with Laplace smoothing for robust probability estimation.
- Extracted vocabulary and word count features from pre-processed SMS messages.
- Calculated class priors, word probabilities, and predictive word ratios to identify strongly indicative words.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, and classification confidence.
- Extended supervised model with semi-supervised learning using either label propagation or active learning on unlabelled data.
- Analyzed the impact of semi-supervised training on model confidence and predictive word importance.

### Skills Demonstrated:
- Text feature engineering
- Probabilistic modeling
- Supervised and semi-supervised learning
- Python programming
- Data analysis
- Evaluation of machine learning models for real-world datasets
